# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project!
While Iâ€™m currently the sole developer, Iâ€™m more than happy to collaborate with contributors who want to improve the codebase.

## How to Contribute

- Create a Pull Request
- Please create a new branch from `main`.
- Implement your change in clear, atomic commits.
- Push your branch and submit a Pull Request.
- keep your commit history linear.
- in general, keep pull requests small

## Code Quality and Formatting

- ESLint: We use ESLint with a shared .eslintrc. Please make sure your code passes ESLint checks.

Prettier: We format code with Prettier â€” follow its configuration for code style.

EditorConfig: Our .editorconfig sets standard settings (indentation, charset, newlines, etc.). Please make sure your IDE is honoring these settings.

## Commit Guidelines

We follow Semantic Commits to keep our history clear and easy to follow.
Your commit messages should follow this format:

```txt
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

Examples:

feat(auth): add login functionality
fix(router): handle invalid routes gracefully
chore(deps): bump dependency versions
```

## Pull Request Process

- Provide a clear description of your change and its purpose.
- Link related issues, if applicable.
- Explain how you have tested your change.
- Wait for a code review before proceeding with a merge.

## Additional Notes

Be excellent to each other, meaning:
be kind, constructive, and helpful in your reviews.

All contributors are valued, whether it's bug fixes, new features, or even improving documentation.

If you have any questions or need guidance, please feel free to reach out.

Let's build something great together. ðŸ’–
